<h1>Idiom # 43: Break outer loop</h1>

<p>See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.programming-idioms.org/idiom/43/break-outer-loop">programming-idioms.org</a>:</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>There is no <code>break</code> or <code>goto</code> in Fuzion, so we have to
help ourselves differently.  In Fuzion, a loop that may execute successfully
(until condition become <code>true</code>) or not (until the iterated set is
exhausted) can be used as a boolean expression. Its value is <code>true</code>
on success.  Consequently, we can use the complete inner loop as the until
condition of the outer loop:</p>
