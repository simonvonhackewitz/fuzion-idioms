<h1>Idiom # 42: Continue outer loop</h1>

<p>See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.programming-idioms.org/idiom/42/continue-outer-loop">programming-idioms.org</a>:</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>There is no <code>continue</code> or <code>goto</code> in Fuzion, so we have
  to help ourselves differently.  In this case, we can let the inner loop
  terminate with an until condition that checks equality of v and u.  If an
  equal pair is found, the loop terminates successfully. In this case, we do not
  want the remaining code in the outer loop to be executed, so we negate the
  value produced by the loop using <code>!</code> and use it as the condition in
  an <code>if</code>:</p>
