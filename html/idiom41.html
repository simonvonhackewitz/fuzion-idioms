<h1>Idiom # 41: Reverse a string</h1>

<p>See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.programming-idioms.org/idiom/41/reverse-a-string">programming-idioms.org</a>:</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>There is no feature in Fuzion's strings to reverse the characters, so we have
to do it manually: First, the string that is usually represented as utf8 is
converted to an array of codepoints.  This array is then reversed and folded
back into a string using string's concat monoid.</p>

<runcode file="../src/idiom41.fuzion"/>

<h2>Running Example</h2>

<runcode file="../src/idiom41ex.fz"/>

<p>Since this example reverse the codepoints and not bytes or utf16 chars, this
also works for unicode chars outside the basic plane:</p>

<runcode file="../src/idiom41ex2.fz"/>
