<h1>Idiom # 73: Create a factory</h1>

<p>See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.programming-idioms.org/idiom/73/create-a-factory">programming-idioms.org</a>:</p>

<p>Fuzion does not support reflection and it is not intended to ever support
reflection.  So there is no way to dynamically create an instance of a feature
whose name is given as a string, but we can statically compare the string
against the name of known heirs in the factory.</p>
